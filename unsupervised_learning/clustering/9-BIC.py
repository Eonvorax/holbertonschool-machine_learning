    """
    Finds the best number of clusters for a Gaussian Mixture Model using the
    Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

    Parameters:
    - X (numpy.ndarray): The dataset to be analyzed, of shape (n, d) where n
    is the number of data points and d is the number of dimensions.
    - kmin (int, optional): The minimum number of clusters to check
    (inclusive). Default is 1.
    - kmax (int, optional): The maximum number of clusters to check
    (inclusive). If None, it is set to the maximum number of clusters possible.
    - iterations (int, optional): The maximum number of iterations for the
    Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Default is 1000.
    - tol (float, optional): The tolerance for convergence of the EM algorithm.
    Default is 1e-5.
    - verbose (bool, optional): If True, prints log likelihood information
    during the EM algorithm execution. Default is False.

    Returns:
    - best_k (int): The optimal number of clusters based on BIC.
    - best_result (tuple): A tuple containing:
        - pi (numpy.ndarray): The priors for each cluster for the best number
        of clusters, of shape (k,).
        - m (numpy.ndarray): The centroid means for each cluster for the best
        number of clusters, of shape (k, d).
        - S (numpy.ndarray): The covariance matrices for each cluster for the
        best number of clusters, of shape (k, d, d).
    - likelihoods (numpy.ndarray): The log likelihoods for each cluster size
    tested, of shape (kmax - kmin + 1).
    - b (numpy.ndarray): The BIC values for each cluster size tested, of
    shape (kmax - kmin + 1).

    Returns `(None, None, None, None)` on failure.
